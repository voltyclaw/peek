Paste a link, then read, watch, and browse the content without the noise of the source app.

## Current features

- Paste links from the clipboard or open Instagram and Reddit links directly.
- Resolve public Instagram posts, reels, and carousels with photos and videos.
- Resolve public Reddit posts, including text, images, galleries, Reddit-hosted video, and `/r/{sub}/s/{id}` share shortlinks.
- Read comments, load more replies, refresh content, and revisit recent links.
- Open media in an edge-to-edge viewer with video playback and carousel navigation.
- Cache resolved content locally for a quicker return experience.

## Availability

| Link type | Availability | Resolver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public Instagram posts (`/p/`) | Available | Direct logged-out GraphQL resolver |
| Public Instagram reels (`/reel/`, `/reels/`) | Available | Direct GraphQL resolver, then hidden WebView fallback |
| Public Instagram carousels | Available | Instagram resolver chain above |
| Public Reddit posts (`/r/{sub}/comments/{id}`, `/comments/{id}`, `/gallery/{id}`, `redd.it/{id}`, `/r/{sub}/s/{share}`) on reddit.com, www, old, np, new, and m | Available | Paste and open-with use the same in-app host classifier. Logged-out JSON is loaded from `www.reddit.com`, then `old.reddit.com` if the first host returns a block page. Share shortlinks follow HTTP redirects, then a canonical or `og:url` in the HTML |
| Reddit subreddit feeds, profiles, search, and posts Reddit hides when logged out | Unsupported | No resolver currently available |
| Private posts, login-required content, challenges, consent flows | Unsupported | No resolver currently available |

Resolvers are selected through a shared prioritized resolver chain, so adding a new source does not require changing the viewer UI.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add Reddit public posts.
- [ ] Add more link sources, including X/Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube.
- [ ] Add more Instagram features, including Stories.
- [ ] Improve sharing, link history, and source-specific viewing experiences.

## Principle and architecture

Peek separates link resolution from presentation. Source-specific resolvers normalize content into shared domain models; repositories handle caching and pagination; ViewModels expose screen state; stateless Jetpack Compose UI renders it.

```mermaid

    A[Shared link] --> B[Resolver chain]
    B --> C[Normalized domain model]
    C --> D[Repository + cache]
    D --> E[ViewModel state]
    E --> F[Jetpack Compose UI]
```

The app is a single-activity Kotlin/Jetpack Compose project. `domain` contains models, repository contracts, and use cases; `data` contains Instagram and Reddit resolution, persistence, caching, and fixtures; `ui` contains navigation, ViewModels, mappers, and rendering.

## Contributing

Peek is early and intentionally small. Ideas, source integrations, design improvements, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome—please include a short description and relevant tests when you can.

## Build and verify

Requires JDK 17 and Android SDK 36.

```shell
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug
./gradlew :app:validateDebugScreenshotTest
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```
